# Delivery Plan

This plan outlines the staged delivery of the local coding agent platform. Each phase builds on the previous one and should conclude with updated documentation and demos where applicable.

## Phase 0 – Planning (Current)
- Draft foundational documents (plan, requirements, design, and task board).
- Identify stakeholders, decision makers, and review cadence.
- Validate that the repository structure supports future automation and testing.

## Phase 1 – Core Infrastructure
- Implement repository bootstrapping scripts to provision a jailed shell workspace per session.
- Build a session manager that tracks user identity, active workspaces, and lifecycle events.
- Establish persistent storage for session metadata and token usage logs.
- Provide smoke tests verifying shell sandbox creation, command execution, and teardown.

## Phase 2 – CLI Agent Experience
- Develop the CLI interface for interacting with the coding agent.
- Integrate the CLI with session management and token accounting services.
- Support task selection from the shared task board and progress reporting back to the task system.
- Add instrumentation for command latency, error rates, and shell resource utilization.

## Phase 3 – Web Application Experience
- Build a web front-end that mirrors CLI functionality with an emphasis on usability.
- Expose APIs for session management, shell interactions, and task state updates.
- Provide authentication and authorization layers to ensure isolated workspaces per user.
- Implement real-time feedback (web sockets or polling) for shell output streaming.

## Phase 4 – Advanced Capabilities
- Offer collaboration features such as shared sessions or task hand-offs.
- Introduce customizable agent personas with different tool-usage policies.
- Expand analytics to include trend reporting, cost forecasting, and alerting on anomalous usage.
- Harden the system with load tests, disaster-recovery drills, and security reviews.

## Phase 5 – Operational Excellence
- Automate deployment and environment updates for both CLI and web interfaces.
- Establish SLOs/SLIs with monitoring dashboards and on-call runbooks.
- Conduct regular documentation reviews to keep requirements, design, and task board current.
- Plan for community contributions, coding standards, and extension mechanisms.

## Review Cadence
- End-of-phase review meetings with key stakeholders to approve progression.
- Weekly backlog grooming using `docs/TASKS.md` to ensure priorities remain aligned.
- Monthly analytics review to assess token consumption and infrastructure costs (once implemented).
