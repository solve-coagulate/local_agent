# Local Coding Agent Workspace

This repository documents the plan for building a local-first coding assistant that can operate via both a command-line interface and a web application. The assistant will coordinate with a jailed shell for workspace execution, support session tracking for multiple users, and capture token-usage analytics.

## Getting Started
1. Review the **Plan**, **Requirements**, **Design**, and **Task Board** documents in the [`docs/`](docs/) directory before working on the project.
2. Update the relevant documentation whenever you add features or make architectural decisions.
3. Keep this top-level README aligned with the current system direction.

## Key Documents
- [`docs/PLAN.md`](docs/PLAN.md) – delivery roadmap and milestones.
- [`docs/REQUIREMENTS.md`](docs/REQUIREMENTS.md) – functional and non-functional expectations.
- [`docs/DESIGN.md`](docs/DESIGN.md) – module-level architecture and integration notes.
- [`docs/TASKS.md`](docs/TASKS.md) – active and upcoming tasks.

## Contributing Guidance
- Follow any instructions in `AGENTS.md` files before making changes.
- Prefer incremental updates: keep documentation accurate as you implement functionality.
- Capture open questions or assumptions in the documentation to help future contributors.

## Current Status
The project is in the planning phase. Implementation work should begin after the initial requirements and design documents are reviewed and approved.
